            working to support refugees.In order to further expand the circle of
            refugee support with the power of young people, the "Youth x UNHCR
            for Refugees Project" was born by volunteer members in the wake of
            "World Refugee Day" in 2020 as a platform.

        <p className={styles.p2}>
          The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
          (UNHCR) was created in 1950, during the aftermath of the Second World
          War, to help millions of Europeans who had fled or lost their
          homes.Today, over 70 years later, our organization is still hard at
          work, protecting and assisting refugees around the world. In order to
          respond to the growing and complex refugee problem, UNHCR receives
          support from governments and private sectors around the world.
